I am a Ph.D. student at [Inria THOTH](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/), supervised by [Michael Arbel](https://michaelarbel.github.io/), [Edouard Pauwels](https://edouardpauwels.fr/), and [Samuel Vaiter](https://samuelvaiter.com/). Prior to that, I obtained a master's degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) and a master's degree in Statistics and Probability from [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/). I also completed a double major in Mathematics and Computer Engineering at the [Lebanese University](https://ul.edu.lb/en). My research interests include statistical learning, bilevel optimization, generative modeling, and sampling methods.
